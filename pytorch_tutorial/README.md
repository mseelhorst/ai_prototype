# PyTorch Tutorial: From Basics to Business Applications

## What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It's one of the most popular deep learning libraries, known for its:

- **Dynamic computation graphs**: Build models on-the-fly with intuitive Python syntax
- **Research-friendly**: Easy to experiment with and modify models
- **Production-ready**: Seamless transition from research to deployment
- **Strong community**: Extensive documentation and active community support

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Tensor Operations**
- Multi-dimensional arrays (similar to NumPy but with GPU support)
- Automatic differentiation for gradient computation
- Efficient mathematical operations

### 2. **Neural Networks**
- Pre-built layers (Linear, Convolutional, LSTM, etc.)
- Automatic gradient computation (backpropagation)
- Flexible model architecture design

### 3. **Deep Learning Models**
- Computer Vision (CNN, ResNet, Vision Transformers)
- Natural Language Processing (RNN, LSTM, Transformers)
- Reinforcement Learning
- Generative Models (GANs, VAEs)

### 4. **GPU Acceleration**
- Seamless CPU/GPU tensor operations
- Distributed training across multiple GPUs
- Mixed precision training for efficiency

## How to Use PyTorch

### Basic Workflow:
1. **Define your model** using `torch.nn.Module`
2. **Prepare your data** using `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`
3. **Choose a loss function** (MSE, CrossEntropy, etc.)
4. **Select an optimizer** (SGD, Adam, etc.)
5. **Train the model** in a loop (forward pass, loss calculation, backprop)
6. **Evaluate and deploy** your trained model

### Example Structure:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# 1. Define model
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(...)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layers(x)

# 2. Initialize model, loss, optimizer
model = MyModel()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# 3. Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(batch.inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, batch.targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```
